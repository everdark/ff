Play with ff!
=======

### Intro
The repo collects sample codes for operation on ff object that mainly leverage the **ffbase** package. Scripts are heavily commented on purpose.

The **ff** programming is crucial for useR to deal with data too large to fit into the physical memory. Though not all operation are supported, most of the conventional and commonly used operation, say, group-by, join, filter, string matching, ..., etc, can be done completely on ff object (i.e., on-disk) alone.
